- **Filter Tasks**: View all tasks, only active tasks, or only completed tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: For building the user interface.

1- Add a Task: Enter the task title and details in the input fields and click the "Add Task" button.
2- Mark a Task as Completed: Click the "Done" button next to a task to mark it as completed.
3- Delete a Task: Click the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it.
